### What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"

I believe that thick mapping in digital humanities is a rather abstract concept that should be applied more often because of the great benefit of understanding multiple voices. Findings from map interpretations often come with biases, so thick mapping attempts to reduce this bias as much as possible by illuminating as much relevant information as possible. 

While mapping involves attributing a narrative or purpose to geographic data, thick mapping not only includes this but also involves bring upon layers of contextual data that provide the ability for data to tell personal stories. Thick mapping places emphasis on context of the data and emphasizes analysis of data from both a closer perspective and zoomed out perspective. Thick mapping allows for multiple interpretations that better inform one's arguments considering these other perspectives.

### How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?

The theory of thick mapping allows me to think more critically about what I perceive and allows me to better understand the world I live in. It allows me to understand my own position relative to others' perceptions when it comes to experiencing important events. For example, the vaccination narrative regarding COVID varies widely among the American populace. The theory of thick mapping allows me to percieve that the vaccination narrative has layers of concern from different ages, races, cultures, and more. The vaccination narrative likely also shifts with time and may echo past concerns made in the past pandemics. Ultimately, the theory of thick mapping allows me to question the status quo and instead consider other possibilities and connections.

## Site Agenda:
This site’s agenda is to bring to light the fact that US Citizens are potentially being surveilled from the sky without our knowledge. 

## Why It Speaks to Me:
This site speaks to me because I was pretty unaware of the fact that these plans were in action. America already has an issue with privacy on the internet, but now people are becoming more aware that we have an issue with privacy in the physical world. I take privacy very seriously so I hope that the government means it when they say that they are solely surveilling the US to follow criminals especially since these planes are able to track cell phones on the ground. 

Another point that speaks out to me is that the FBI seems to be surveilling neighborhoods with large Muslim populations (e.g. Little Kabul in Fremont, CA) evidenced in the time-lapse map despite the FBI denying this. This issue may speak to the xenophobia that exists in America. 

## How does the mapping work, and does it work?
The mapping works by tracking the flights registered to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and  the flights of airplanes registered to companies created as a fronts for the FBI. The data was provided by Flightradar24 who collected data via radio signal broadcast by transponders that reveal the plane’s locations and identifying information. This map does work as it it highlights areas that are especially surveilled that are perhaps due to the tragic events leading up to and after events like mass shootings. 

## Technologies used:
This site uses Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, and CartoDB.

## Changes I would make:
I do not have much criticism for the site, as I believe it was designed and implemented well. Additionally, this site won the Kantar Information is Beautiful Award in 2019. However, I would suggest that the site change its colors for the legend to Navy and Grey, as red has a generally negative association and implies that the FBI is more dangerous than DHS. This map is only trying to objectively show the routes of both organizations.

## Reaction to "Introduction to UXD"

A particular quote that I liked from the article is that “there is no need to reinvent the wheel each time” and that designers can and should use available internet resources and common design practices to promote consistency. I think this concept was hard to accept for me because throughout my entire education, I was taught to seek out originality. However, in the case of UX, originality may not always be the best decision if it drastically differs from current conventions. I’m currently taking DH110 Intro to UX Design and appreciate how this article is validating what I am learning (for example, advocating the use of heuristic evaluation).

## Reaction to "What is user experience design?"

I like how this video simplifies the process of UX design into four stages: understand the user, defining a problem, designing a solution, and making the product fun to use. The previous article mentioned how sometimes it is difficult for him to explain his job to family members or friends, but this video gives a brief description of what he does. I also like how the video allows the viewer to realize the invisible impact of good user design.

## Questions For Alesha: 

**Question 1:** I’m currently in the process of deviating away from a math background and am instead pivoting towards UX design. I was wondering if you have any advice as to what I should do over the summer to make the most out of it.

**Question 2:** How was the transition from working at an advertising agency to working at a large tech corporation? What is your favorite project that you have worked on over your career?

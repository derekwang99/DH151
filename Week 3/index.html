		<b> My Favorite Places That I have Traveled To </b> </br></br>

		<p>
			This map shows a few of my favorite places I have traveled to before the pandemic.
		By far my absolute favorite spots were Taiwan and Singapore. Taiwanese night markets are abound with lots of activities, eateries, and shopping.
		Singapore was just a great place to get good food from many different cultures. My favorite dish from Singapore was probably the Hainanese Chicken Rice.
		I was supposed to go to Vietnam and Korea last summer, but COVID-19 put a stop to those plans. I do hope to visit those countries in the near future, though!
